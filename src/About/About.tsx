            During middle school, my teacher decided to introduce me to the wonderful
            world of programming through Scratch; however, after about half an hour, I
            dismissed it as lame.

            Cut to today, and I am now heading off to <span className='text-about-me-blue'>the University
              of Waterloo to study Computer Science</span>. As I developed, so did my enjoyment for
            trying new things and learning to love learning. Although I am seemingly on a
            path to a career in Software, I absolutely adore electronics and hardware
            (especially robotics)

            Anyways, here on my website, I hope to share my
            <span className='text-about-me-blue'>experiences, projects, and insights</span> as I continue to grow and explore!
